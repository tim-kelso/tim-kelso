- 👋 Hi, I’m @tim-kelso
- 👀 I’m interested in education research, data analytics, and data visualisation.
  All of my current work projects are in private repos as they involve confidential research data, but I'm looking to start working on some public side projects soon, especially with transport and climate data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and using R and the tidyverse, as well as creating reproducible workflows
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on education and climate data projects
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothykelso/
