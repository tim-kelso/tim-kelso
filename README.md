- 👋 Hi, I’m @tim-kelso
- 👀 I’m interested in education research, data analytics, and data visualisation.
  All of my current day-job projects are in private repos as they involve confidential research data, but I'm looking to start working on some public side projects soon, especially with transport and climate data
- 🌱 I’m currently using R and the tidyverse, and I'm now learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on education and climate data projects
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothykelso/
